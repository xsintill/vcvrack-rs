# VCVRack-rs

A VCV Rack clone written in Rust.

## Description

In the current state it's not usable for users. Currently it's a way for me to test whether I can get it to resemble VCV Rack written in Rust simply by prompting Cursor.
Hopefully this will help me learn Rust and Sound Synthesis along the way.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- [List any other dependencies]

### Installation
`cargo run`
